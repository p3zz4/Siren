This is a music visualization project.

In order to run the Siren you'll need to:
* add '.mp3' files to the directory './data/music'
* run these commands:
  * npm run server
  * npm run db
* finally use file selector (located in the Siren's right panel) to select which songs you want to add to the playlist
